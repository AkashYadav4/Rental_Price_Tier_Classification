# Regarding the Dataset:
Original dataset: rentalApartments_data.csv
After data cleaning and pre-processing: cleanedApartments_data.xlsx
After handling outliers (final dataset for model training and testing): FinalApartments_data.csv

# Data Cleaning:
Data cleaning and handling of missing values were performed using the file: rentalAnalysis.ipynb.
You can run this notebook directly. Before running, ensure that the dataset paths specified in the code are correct.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
All EDA coding is available in rentalprice-visualization.ipynb.
You can either run this notebook directly or view all the required visualizations in the project_visualization folder.

# Outlier Detection and Handling:
Outlier detection and handling were performed using: outlier_handling.ipynb.
You can run this notebook directly, or review all outlier detection and handling visualizations within the notebook itself or in the project_visualization folder.

# Model Selection:
We trained the dataset using six different models:
- KNN
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- AdaBoost

# Model notebook files:
Random_Forest_and_Decision_Tree.ipynb
Naive_Bayes_and_AdaBoost.ipynb
Logistic_Regression.ipynb
KNN.ipynb

# Model Visualizations
All required model visualizations are saved in the project_visualization folder and are also available within each notebook. 
These include:
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve
- Feature Importance

# Notes
Before running any code, ensure that the dataset file paths in the notebooks are correct.
Some code sections may take time to execute.
All steps and results are documented and visualized within the respective notebooks for easy reference.

Thank you.
